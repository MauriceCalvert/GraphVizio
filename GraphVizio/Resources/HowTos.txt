title Fix connectors that aren't correctly glued to a shape
opensample broken.vsd
goto right
say The connectors in this diagram are not correctly glued. 
say This is obvious for the red ones, which are partially or not connected at all.
say The blue one looks right, but its ends are under the shapes, not glued.
goto menu
say To fix the connectors, use the Connectors -> Fix unglued option

say Notice that these select functions are additive - 
say the shapes currently selected are not deselected first

title Layout groups of connected shapes in separate areas
opensample clusters.vsd
goto left
say This diagram contains 3 sets of connected shapes
say Blue, green and orange, which we would like to layout in 3 clusters
goto menu
say This is achieved with the Shapes -> Auto-Cluster
showmenu 5 1
shapesautocluster
say The 3 clusters are now in 3 seperate layers
say Change the algorithm to clustered
check fdp
say and layout

title Keep shapes together in groups
opensample threecountries.vsd
goto left
say This diagram is correct, but it would be clearer if cities were grouped by country
say (English cities are blue, French cites are gree, Italian cities are yellow)

say This is achieved by clustering
say First select British cities

select london birmingham cardiff
say and cluster them
showmenu 5 2
shapescluster
say then select the French cities and cluster them
say and select the Italian cities and cluster them
select paris lyon bordeaux
shapescluster
select milano roma torino

say With the flat layout, the shapes don't cluster by country
check neato
layout
say but with the clustered layout, the cities are grouped by country

title View the Introduction to GraphVizio
say Thank you for installing GraphVizio
say This short demonstration will enable you to quickly understand how GraphVizio works
say It only takes a moment, rest assured that it will be well spent
goto bottom
opensample orgchart.vsd
say We shall start with a hierarchical drawing.
say Let's layout this simple organisation chart 
layout
say Here, the connectors are straight lines, between centres
say A more traditional layout would use dynamic connectors
goto menu
say The Graph -> Settings menu option opens the GraphVizio settings window
showmenu 1
goto settings
say Check the specific connector option
check connectoris	
say ... change the connector to dynamic
set connectorname dynamic
say and connect to "top and bottom"
check topbottom
layout
say The diagram can be made more compact by resizing the shapes
goto menu
say To maintain the proportions, we'll use "Size to Widest"
showmenu 5 8
sizetowidest
say As a final variant, we can apply a pre-defined corporate style,
say where the shape varies according to the rank
check shapeis
set shapename orgchart+
say The orgchart+ shape has three shapes, orgchart0, orgchart1 and orgchart2
say Nodes are drawn using the shape that has its rank (0, 1, 2, etc.)
layout
close

say Certain hierarchical diagrams can be cumbersome to layout nicely
goto centre
opensample sitemap.vsd
say Here is the Sitemap of an online bank
zoom 50
zoom 25
zoom page
say It exhibits a common hierarachical layout problem, where the diagram becomes extremely wide
goto settings
say This can be remedied using the "Stack Leaves" option, which places leaf nodes vertically under their parent
set leafstack all
say "Lowest" only stacks leaves with the lowest rank
say "All" stacks all leaves, regardless of rank.

say As this diagram is quite large, we'll suppress screen updating whilst drawing
say (This option can be set permanently in Tools->Options)
updating off
layout
updating on
zoom 25
zoom 50
close

goto centre
say The next type of drawing are those without hierarchy (flat), for example database relationships
opensample labtesting.csv.vsd
say These are the relationships in a database designed to monitor laboratory testing processes
say They are prepared in a CSV (Comma Separated Variable) file like this

say The primary table Authority 
say has Method with a foreign key

say The primary table Business 
say has BusinessMeasure with a foreign key
say and so on
close
goto menu
say Use the Import CSV option to read this CSV file and lay it out
showmenu 4 2
importcsv labtesting.csv
say Observe what happens when we layout a second time
layout
say Notice how the layout changes at each successive layout
say This is controlled by the "SEED" parameter, which is incremented at each layout.
check lockseed
say You can lock the seed to its current value when a given layout is pleasing so that the subsequent layouts will remain the same.
uncheck lockseed
layout
close
say That concludes the introduction to GraphVizio
