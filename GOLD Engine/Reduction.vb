    ' Class Name:
    '      Reduction
    '
    ' Instancing:
    '      Public; Creatable  (VB Setting: 2 - PublicNotCreatable)
    '
    ' Purpose:
    '      This class is used by the engine to hold a reduced rule. Rather the contain
    '      a list of Symbols, a reduction contains a list of Tokens corresponding to the
    '      the rule it represents. This class is important since it is used to store the
    '      actual source program parsed by the Engine.
